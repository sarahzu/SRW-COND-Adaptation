# SRW-COND-Adaption
This project implements the SRW-COND algorithm, first introduced in Xiao D., Wang R. &amp; Wu L. (2016) on a small dataset. 

The SRW-COND algorithm is a way of using latent attribute inference in social networks to generate better user information. The algorithm was first introduced in: 
Xiao, D., Wang, R., & Wu, L. (2016). Latent Attribute Inference of Users in Social Media with Very Small Labeled Dataset. IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems, 99(10), 2612-2618.
